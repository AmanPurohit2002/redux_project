# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live Demo
[Shopping-Cart Demo](https://shoppingcarty.netlify.app/)

## Shopping-Cart-App
A shopping cart app made with React, Redux and CSS. This is a learning project for the usage of Redux.

## About Project 
Welcome Folks. This is my internship project in which I have to make the shopping cart page using Redux. This is a learning project for the usage of Redux.

## Features
1) Shopping cart functionality \
2) Ability to add/remove items from the cart \
3) Cart page which calculates the total price of products in the cart \

## Tech Stack
React\
Redux\

## Running Locally
To run this project locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Shopping-Cart-App.git
Change into the new directory:



cd Shopping-Cart-App


Install the required dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start


Now, you should be able to view the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Feel free to submit any issues or feature requests you may have, and happy coding!






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
